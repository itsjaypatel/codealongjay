# Advanced Java Development Topics for Interview Preparation

When preparing for Java development interviews, it's essential to delve into topics that are often overlooked yet crucial for demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the language and its ecosystem. Below is a curated list of such topics, along with recommended resources, including GitHub repositories and tutorials, to master them.

## 1. JVM Internal Working

Understanding the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is vital for optimizing application performance and effective debugging.

## 3. Concurrency and Multithreading

A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the program’s execution.

Writing correct multi-threaded application is complex and it’s an advanced topic. Things like ParallelStreams, thread-safe Collections and ExecutorService can be helpful.

## 4. Collection Framework

The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects. Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

## 5. Java Streams and Lamda

Java provides a new additional package in Java 8 called java.util.stream. This package consists of classes, interfaces and enum to allows functional-style operations on the elements. You can use stream by importing java.util.stream package.

## 7. Exception Handling

Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

## 8. Serialization

Serialization is the conversion of the state of an object into a byte stream; deserialization does the opposite. Stated differently, serialization is the conversion of a Java object into a static stream (sequence) of bytes, which we can then save to a database or transfer over a network.

## 9. SOLID Principles

Familiarity with SOLID principles is crucial for creating maintainable and scalable object-oriented designs.

## 10. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

Knowledge of JDBC is essential for interacting with databases and performing CRUD operations in Java applications.
